About Me
Hi, I'm Mahmood! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m passionate about building free, practical desktop applications that solve real-world problems and make everyday tasks easier. My projects focus on simplicity, usability, and accessibility, because I believe useful tools should be available to everyone.

I enjoy turning ideas into functional software and continuously learning new technologies along the way. Whether you're a developer, hobbyist, or just someone curious about my work, feel free to explore my repositories.

Letâ€™s create something meaningful together! ðŸš€
